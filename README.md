`speed`: for example 500 (lower numbers make the playback faster)

> **Note:**
> The URL gets maybe automaticly converted by the browser from `https://core-scroll.netlify.com/#Test Title 500` to the URL `https://core-scroll.netlify.com/#Test%20Title%20500` without spaces.
> Both work exactly the same
